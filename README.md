# project-euler
My organization of project euler solutions - going to work through them in Javascript this time instead of C# and C++

## To use:  
1. Copy an existing `problem-NNNN` folder adjusting the name to reflect the problem number  
2. `cd` to your new problem folder:  
3. Open `problem.js`  
4. Edit the `Inputs` as appropriate  
```
/* ========================================== */
/* Inputs                                     */

const problemNumber = 1

const problemTitle = 'Placeholder for Problem Title'

const problemDefinition = `This is a placeholder
for any given problem's definition`

const expectedSolution = 42

/* ========================================== */
```  
5. Save  
6. Open the `solution.js` file    
7. Immplement your solution  
8. Update `solveAsynce`'s Promise resolve to return the result of your solution  
9. Save  
10. Run the `problem.js` file  
```
